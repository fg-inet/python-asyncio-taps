Welcome to PyTAPS's documentation!
==================================

PyTAPS is an implementation of a **transport system** as described by the **TAPS (Transport Services)** Working Group in the IETF in `draft-ietf-taps-interface-03 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-taps-interface-03>`_.

PyTAPS provides an asynchronous programming interface which allows applications to transmit and receive messages over transport protocols and network paths dynamically selected at runtime.
